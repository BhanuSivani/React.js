React Reducer()
a reducer is a function that helps to update (like score,a list)based on   action we take
Current State: the current value of a state
Action: Add or remove an item
TRACKING APPLES:                     

callback in react:
in react a call back is function that is passed as an argument to another function
call backs are often to communicate with different components
EX: A parent component passing as a callback to a child 
-parent component displays a messgae; and child component has a button 
-When the button is clicked, the child will use callback 

import React,{useReducer} from "react";
function appleReducer(state=3,action){
  switch(action.type){
    case 'ADD_APPLE':
      return state+1;
    case 'EAT_APPLE':
      return state-1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function App(){
  const[state,dispatch]=useReducer(appleReducer)
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>Apple Counter</h1>
      <p>Number of apples:{state}</p>
      <button onClick={()=>dispatch({type:'ADD_APPLE'})}>Add APPLE</button>
      <button onClick={()=>dispatch({type:'EAT_APPLE'})}>EAT APPLE</button>
    </div>
  )
}
export default App;
